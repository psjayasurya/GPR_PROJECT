GPR VR Explorer:

The GPR VR Explorer is a specialized web-based application designed for the visualization and analysis of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) data. It transforms raw geophysical CSV data into immersive 3D/VR environments.

🚀 Core Functionalities

1. Data Processing & Management

  	Large Dataset Support: Efficiently handles CSV/text files up to 1GB, utilizing binary processing techniques.
  	Multi-threaded Execution: Processing happens in the background, allowing users to track progress in real-time without freezing the UI.
  	Flexible Data Mapping: Custom column indices for X, Y, Z, and Amplitude, making it compatible with various GPR device outputs.
 	Persistent Storage: Organized job-based storage for uploads and processed results, with integrated cleanup and ZIP download capabilities.

2. Advanced Filtering & Analysis

	Amplitude Percentile Filtering: Enables users to filter out noise and focus on the most significant subsurface reflections.
	ISO-Level Layering: Automatically segments data into discrete amplitude ranges (bins), allowing for detailed layer-by-layer inspection.
	Horizontal Depth Slices: Generates cross-sectional slices at various depths to visualize subsurface structures horizontally.
	Surface Mesh Generation: Creates interpolated 3D surfaces based on peak amplitude depths to map continuous soil or utility boundaries.

3. Immersive VR Visualization

	WebXR Integration: Fully compatible with VR headsets (like Meta Quest) for true 6-DoF exploration of subsurface data.
	3D Point Cloud Rendering: Uses high-performance Three.js/PLY vertex rendering to display millions of data points smoothly.
	Interactive Control Panel:
	Layer Visibility: Toggle individual amplitude ranges on/off via a checklist.
       	Visual Tuning: Real-time adjustment of point size, surface opacity, and slice transparency.
     	Scale & Position: Dynamic scaling of the entire model to fit the user's workspace.
	3D Asset Integration: Supports overlaying external 3D pipe models (.ply) with manual alignment tools (Scale, Position, Rotation) to compare GPR findings with known utility maps.

4. Scientific Aesthetics

	20+ Professional Color Palettes: Includes perceptually uniform palettes like Viridis, Plasma, and Inferno for accurate data interpretation, plus traditional Seismic and Geological themes.
	Visual Aids: Built-in 3D axes, ground guides, and a dynamic compass UI for spatial orientation.
	Custom Legend: Generates a dynamic amplitude-to-color legend based on the current data range and selected palette.
